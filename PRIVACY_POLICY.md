# GoFinance: Privacy policy

Welcome to GoFinance app!

This is an open source Android app developed by Gabriel Porto. The source code is available on GitHub under the MIT license and the app is available on Google Play.

As an user myself, I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

All data collected is used just to store with the finances created by you, in that way no other account can see others data.

E.g., the account with name: "Example1" and address: "example1@gmail.com" can only see the data created when logged with that account, just like the "B", "C", etcetera.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
Gabriel Porto.
Goiania, Brasil.
